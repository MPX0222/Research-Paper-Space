In this thesis, there are 4 paradigms in NLP: Fully Supervised Learning(Non-NN), Fully Supervised Learning(NN), PreTrain-FineTune(After2018) and PreTrain-Prompt-Predict. With the development of Transformer and Language Models, there are more NLP tasks. If researchers still use PreTrain-FineTune to tune Large Language Model in specific tasks, it would cost massive computing resources, which is extremely unrealistic. Hence, PreTrain-Prompt-Predict is a significant and efficient paradigms that makes LLMs to fit different tasks without tuning of re-training.*

>  ***Summarize** : Survey and Evaluation of ICL. In-Context Learning is firstly proposed in the work of GPT-3. However, it was used as tricks before the conclusion in the paper, and play an indispensable role in the training process of LLMs. ICL uses the demonstration of the tasks or show some samples of these tasks. Then, a designed mode is used to combine these samples to a natural language prompt and add to the input of LLMs. The efficiency and effectiveness of ICL is influenced by the design of samples. In the pre-training phase, the LLM essentially encodes the implicit model through its parameters. In the forward computation phase, LLM can implement learning algorithms such as gradient descent through the examples provided in ICL, or directly compute closed solutions to update these models. In addition Chain-of-Thought(CoT) is proposed to optimize the performance of LLMs in complex inference tasks, which can be combined with ICL in the situation of Few-Shot or Zero-Shot. It's worth noting that In-Context Learning is not as same as the Long Context, which require Large Language Models to store more information from the past interaction.*

>  ***Summarize** : GLM and GLM-130B faced a lot of challenge when it was firstly proposed, including Lack of CPUs and GPUs, Lack of a Robust Pre-Training Methods, Lack of fast inference solution especially in low computing resources. TsingHua Researchers proposed the training details GLM-130B aiming to provide others a reference about how to train a Large Language Model(100B-Scale), because "It is not easy to train a Large Language Model". GLM-130B use GLM as the backbone, with the methods of Layer Norm, Positional Encoding, FFNs. In the Training Stability Stage, Mixed-Precision(FP16 & FP32) and Embedding Layer Gradient Shrink is used. In addition, GLM-130B was distrubuted in 96 NVIDIA A100-40GB for training(60 Days). In this process, Research teams usually faced the challenges of the lack of GPUs(Even they gained some support from several platforms, they have to edit their codes to fit these platforms or even re-code in C++). Therefore, in the inference stage of GLM-130B, researchers use INT8 and even INT4 to quantize the model weights and the activations, which makes the model can run the inference on RTX 2080Ti.*

>
>  ***Summarize** : We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like FlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long context question-answer pairs. *
